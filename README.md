  The first iteration of <a href="https://vast-ravine-41433.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">lmfao.com</a> built with <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> and hosted with <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>

  This is a presentational website for the NPM package that I created named "lmfao" which leverages end-to-end encryption to allow anyone (software engineers, developers, product managers, students, etc.) to chat with their coworkers and friends through the terminal on public or password-protected (by the user) private channels. Conversations are not recorded, Google Cloud services are used to store and authenticate users, while AWS is used to relay messages. Current maximum capacity for one single open channel is 1,000 users although I doubt that a single channel channel will most ever reach this level of chaos.

  The website holds a mock terminal created through React. By interacting with it and typing within its command line the correct commands, you'll learn more about this **revolutionary** npm package,and you'll also be able to send me an email (through the "Contact Me" button) in case you want to speak with me.

  I used <a href="https://github.com/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack"> simple-react-full-stack </a> as the boilerplate for my code. It was a perfect alternative to the very useful create-react-app boilerplate released by Facebook because it already includes Express and Node.js. Thank you to the contributors of simple-react-full-stack, such as Sandeep Raveesh <a href="https://github.com/crsandeep"> @crsanddeep </a>, for this boilerplate and for putting in the time and effort in creating it. It is very much appreciated.
