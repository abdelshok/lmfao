  The first iteration of <a href="https://vast-ravine-41433.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">lmfao.com</a> built with <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> and hosted with <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>

<p align="center">
  This is a presentational website for the NPM package that I created named "lmfao" which allows any engineer, developer, product manager, student, and general person to chat with their friends and coworkers through the terminal. 
</p>

<p align="center">
  No conversations are recorded, users can chat on public channels, or create private channels that are password protected to chat with their friends privately, and end-to-end encryption is implemented in order to prevent *anyone* from being able to track user messages.
