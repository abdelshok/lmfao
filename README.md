  The first iteration of <a href="https://vast-ravine-41433.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">lmfao.com</a> built with <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> and hosted with <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>

<p align="center">
  This is a presentational website for my published NPM package named "lmfao" which leverages end-to-end encryption to allow anyone (software engineers, developers, product managers, students, etc.) to chat with their coworkers and friends through the terminal on public or password-protected (by the user) private channels. Conversations are not recorded, Google Cloud services are used to store and authenticate users, while AWS is used to relay messages. Current maximum capacity for one single open channel is 1,000 users although I doubt that a single channel will ever reach this level of chaos.

  The website contains a "mock" terminal created through React. By interacting with it and typing the correct commands within the command line, you'll learn more about this my *beautiful* npm package, and you'll also be able to send me an email (through the "Contact Me" button) in case you want to contact me.

  I used <a href="https://github.com/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack"> simple-react-full-stack </a> as the boilerplate for my code. Thank you to Sandeep Raveesh, <a href="https://github.com/crsandeep"> @crsanddeep </a>, for putting in the time and effort in creating it.
